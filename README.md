# PDF Creator

This is a programme that produced by IntelliJ, Maven and uses iText7, to take input from a text file (``Input.txt``)
and produces a PDF output file (``Output.pdf``). This programme consists of 3 parts.

### Introduction

The programme PDF Creator will:

1. Read from the text file, store all the content into the ``InputContent`` file as a LinkedHashMap.
    1. The structure as follows:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="3"> <tt>allParagraphs</tt> </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="3"> <i>Paragraph 1</i> </td>
            <td colspan="2"> <tt>Paragraph</tt> </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>text 1</td>
            <td> commands</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>text 2</td>
            <td> commands</td>
          </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3"> <i>Paragraph 2</i> </td>
            <td colspan="2"> <tt>Paragraph</tt> </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>text 1</td>
            <td> commands</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

2. The ``CreatorController`` will print out all the paragraphs once via ``writeAllParas``
3. Repeat the content if needed
4. Add pagination to all the pages

---

### 1. CreatorRunner

The ``CreatorRunner`` class provides the entry point to the program.

### 2. ParagraphContent

The ``ParagraphContent`` class provides a data structures for the paragraph as a LinkedHashMap, which contains text and
commands.

**Functionality:**

1. A constructor that accepts parameters and creates a ``paragraph`` LinkedHashMap, when there is a new paragraph
2. The ``addTextWithCommands`` method that accepts the text and the commands for styling it, then store them inside a
   ``paragraph`` LinkedHashMap, called in the constructor
3. Methods that return texts and commands of a paragraph

### 3. InputContent

The ``InputContent`` class read the input file , and determine whether they are a command or text, then store all the
texts and commands as separated paragraphs.

**Functionality:**

1. Provides a constant that represent the text file for inputs
2. Create a constructor that reads from the ``Input.txt`` file so that the programme can move between different
   paragraphs and texts
    1. Read from the input file
    2. Determine the input, put it inside the ``command`` ArrayList or store inside the String ``text``
    3. After storing all the commands for a text
        1. put them inside ``allParagraphs`` LinkedHashMap
        2. reset the ``text`` and ``commands`` for next input
3. The ``detectInput`` method detect whether the input is a text or a command
4. The ``checkIfNewPara`` and ``checkIfReady`` methods check if a text has met the condition of starting a new paragraph
5. Implements the methods that return the keys of ``allParagraphs`` and get the paragraph from ``allParagraphs``

### 4. PdfEditor

The ``PdfEditor`` class writes and style all the text onto the PDF, alongside with adding the page number onto the PDF
and closing it, the class also contains a LinkedHashMap that store all the paragraphs. It provides all the getter and
setter, all styling command functions.

**Functionality:**

1. Provides a constant that represent the pdf file
2. Creates the necessary variables for editing a PDF, and default formatting
3. Create a constructor to initialize the PDF file for writing and get the default formatting
4. Set the text for later styling, select the correct command function according to parameters
5. Provides all the required functions to write on the PDF and commands for styling the text

### 5. CreatorController

The ``CreatorController`` class initialize writing the contents, repeat the texts to render **at least 3 pages** of
content.

**Functionality:**

1. Create two objects, one represents the ``PDFEditor`` and one represents the input file
2. Create methods to write and repeat all the contents
3. Print out all the paragraphs once via ``writeAllParas``
4. The ``run`` method then determine if the PDF has **at least 3 pages of contents**, and close the document
